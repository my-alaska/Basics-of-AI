# Basics-of-AI

This repository conains code solutions for Basics of Artificial Inteligence course that I'm taking during my 5th semester of computer science studies at AGH university of science and technology

The tasks are [provided by a teacher](https://github.com/apohllo/sztuczna-inteligencja) in a form of .ipynb notebook files. Students solve those by filling the missing pieces of code

In this repository each directory contains code and data for separate laboratory exercise
